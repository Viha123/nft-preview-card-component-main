## My process
I wanted to learn flexbox while doing this project, so I used a lot of flexbox concepts, and I am happy to say that I learned a lot. I learned about most of the basic flex properties, and I think I can use it on other projects as well. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned Flexbox! 


```css
body{
    background: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding-left: 50px;
    padding-right: 50px;
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - Helped me with using the right units. I don't think I have still used the correct units all the time, but I now have a rough idea. 
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.example.com) - I used this to learn Flexbox and do the basic Flexbox exercises.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) helped me with basic flexbox properties, and visualizing what is happening in things like justify content, or align-items.
